  ````css
  body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
  }
  - display: none (This will collapse anything around it.)
  - visibility: hidden (this will simply "hide" the elements.)
  ```css
    * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  ````

  -- Horizontal: display: flex;
  -- perspective: 1000px; We used this to tilt the "screen" inward.
